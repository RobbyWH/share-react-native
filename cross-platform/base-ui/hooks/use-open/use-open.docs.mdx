## A React Hook to handle an open / close status

### Component usage

Run toggleOpen to change the status of isOpen

In this example clicking the button calls `toggleOpen` which flips the isOpen boolean.

```js live
() => {
  const { isOpen, toggleOpen } = useOpen();
  return (
    <>
      The isOpen status is {isOpen.toString()}
      
        Change Status
      
    </>
  );
};
```
